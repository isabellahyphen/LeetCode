# LeetCode
LeetCode problems, mostly on Algorithms and Data Structures and solved in Python, C++ and Java.

* The repository is organized in folders: one folder for the main algorithm or data structure necessary to tackle the problem in optimal Time and Space Complexity.
* In  each folder there will be one sub-folder per numbered LeetCode problem: each sub-folder will contain one file per programming language solution and sometimes multiple solutions (e.g. solution with/without Dynamic Programminmg)
* Usually the Python file solution will contain a description of the logic employed
